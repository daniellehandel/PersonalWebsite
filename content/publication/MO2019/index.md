abstract: Nearly half of current U.S. Congressmembers served in their state legislature prior to holding federal office. We quantify the effect of state legislative service on individuals' career progression to Congress using the universe of U.S. state legislature elections since 1967. While only four percent of state legislature candidates ever run for Congress, we empirically establish that an additional term in the state legislature nearly doubles the probability that a given individual will be seen contesting a Congressional seat in the future. We then evaluate heterogeneity in this effect across institutional settings -- namely, across dimensions of legislative professionalism. We show that the effect of state legislative service on career progression is larger in more professionalized legislatures, and stronger for ideological conservatives as well as ideological extremists. Overall, the paper confirms that institutions matter for career advancement among politicians.
