abstract: This paper will estimate the effects on household expenditure and well-being of an at-scale unconditional cash transfer (UCT) program that annually provides over USD300 million in humanitarian assistance to Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Since 2016, this program has relied on a  proxy-means test (PMT) to target UCTs to the most vulnerable refugee households in Lebanon. For empirical identification, we will exploit two sharp discontinuities in households' program eligibility that occur along a continuous measure of predicted household expenditure generated by the PMT. The annual targeting cycle allows us to use multiple waves of existing observational data across several rounds of the program to estimate the local average treatment effect of assistance on household well-being around the assignment thresholds up to three years after cash transfer receipt. Our primary hypotheses will be tested using outcomes based on household expenditure, child labor/education/marriage, health, and measures of vulnerability and reliance on negative coping strategies. <strong> Pre-analysis plan registered (OSF) on 18 December 2019</a>
