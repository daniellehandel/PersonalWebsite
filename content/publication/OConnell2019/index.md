abstract: A one-third quota rule for women in local political leadership seats in India increases the number of female candidates who later contest seats in state and national legislatures. This arises from the candidacy of beneficiaries who gained political experience due to the quotas and career politicians who continue contesting in longer-exposed areas. The policy accounts for a substantial portion of the increase in female candidates for high office since the mid-1990's. Women have a higher probability of a top finish when running on major party tickets or contesting in areas that overlap with their local constituency. <br> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3103111">SSRN WP</a> | <a href="https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/11286/can-quotas-increase-the-supply-of-candidates-for-higher-level-positions-evidence-from-local-government-in-india">IZA Discussion Paper 11286</a> <br> <a href="https://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/social-identity/quota-policies-and-career-advancement-evidence-from-indian-politics.html">I4I (English |</a> <a href="https://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/social-identity/quota-policies-and-career-advancement-evidence-from-indian-politicshindi.html"> Hindi)</a> | <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/0EOMXN2KBB6wFsZ5nDNFdJ/Quota-policies-and-career-advancement-in-politics.html">livemint</a>
