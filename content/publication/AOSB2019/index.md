abstract: We develop and assess the performance of an econometric targeting model for unconditional cash assistance to Syrian refugees in Lebanon. We use LASSO regression to derive a prediction model for household expenditure using demographic and background characteristics from routinely collected administrative data. This approach compares favorably to the common, costlier “scorecard” Proxy Means Test (PMT) requiring short household surveys of the entire target population. We then validate the model with a contemporaneous out-of-sample test, which supports our primary conclusions. Finally, we show empirically that some behaviors indicative of high levels of vulnerability are positively associated with expenditure per capita – lending support for additional structures to allow potential beneficiaries the opportunity to access aid.
