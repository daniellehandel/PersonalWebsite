abstract: We develop and assess the performance of an econometric targeting model for unconditional cash and food assistance  to Syrian refugees in Lebanon. We use a regularized linear regression method to derive a prediction model for household expenditure based on demographic and background characteristics from routinely collected administrative data. This approach compares favorably to the common, costlier "scorecard" Proxy Means Test (PMT) that requires a short household survey of the entire target population. We then validate the model with a contemporaneous out-of-sample test. Finally, we show that some behaviors indicative of high levels of vulnerability are positively associated with expenditure per capita -- lending support for additional structures to allow potential beneficiaries the opportunity to access aid.
