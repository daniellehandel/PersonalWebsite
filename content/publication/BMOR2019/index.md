abstract: This paper establishes the presence of a substantial gender gap in the effect of serving in the state legislature on political career progression. Specifically, we find that the increase in the probability of ever running for Congress after winning a term in the state legislature is twice as large for men as it is for women. Moreover, the effect on winning a Congressional seat after winning a term in the state legislature is five times larger for men than women. This gender gap in career progression starts early in legislators' careers, widens over time, and is seen alongside a higher propensity for female state legislators to recontest state legislature seats. The differential return to state legislature service we find is not generated by gender differences in previously accumulated political experience, educational credentials, political party affiliation, or constituency characteristics.
