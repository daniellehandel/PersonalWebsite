abstract: We establish the existence of gender differences in career progression to leadership positions among U.S. politicians and study their underlying causes. Using a close elections strategy, we find that an additional state legislature term increases the probability of ever running for Congress by twice as much for men as it does for women and the effect on winning a Congressional race is five times larger for men than women.  These gaps emerge early in legislators' careers, widen over time, and are seen alongside a higher propensity of female politicians to continue running for the state legislature. The gap cannot be attributed to  differences in experience, career-family tradeoffs, election or constituency characteristics, nor preferences for part-time public service careers.  <br> <a href="https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/12569/gender-differences-in-political-career-progression-evidence-from-us-elections">IZA Discussion Paper No. 12569 (August 2019)</a>
