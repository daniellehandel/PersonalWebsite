abstract: We quantify the link between the timing of state-level implementations of political reservations for women in India with the role of women in Indiaâ€™s manufacturing sector. While overall employment of women in manufacturing does not increase after the reforms, we find significant evidence that more women-owned establishments were created in the unorganized/informal sector. These new establishments were concentrated in industries where women entrepreneurs have been traditionally active and the entry was mainly found among household-based establishments. We measure and discuss the extent to which this heightened entrepreneurship is due to channels like greater financial access or heightened inspiration for women entrepreneurs. <br><a href="https://github.com/steveoconnell/GKO_Reservations_JDE2014_ReplBackup">Replication files</a><br><a href="http://www.voxeu.org/article/political-reservations-and-women-s-entrepreneurship-india">VoxEU</a>
