abstract: We study whether and how increasing the number of women in career stages that precede high-level positions affects female representation at the top of the career ladder. We exploit state legislature elections narrowly won by female candidates in India to examine the effect of expanding the pipeline of women in local politics on subsequent female representation and success in parliamentary elections. For each additional state legislature election won by a woman, there is a 34 percent increase in the number of female candidates contesting in the subsequent parliamentary election, and a 2.6 percentage-point increase in the average vote share won per female parliamentary candidate. We find that this relationship is driven by new female politicians, and not by the progression of female state legislators nor an increase in the number of past female parliamentary candidates.
