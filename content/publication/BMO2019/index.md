abstract: We study whether and how increasing the supply of women in career stages that precede high-level positions affects female representation at the top of the career ladder. We exploit state legislature elections narrowly won by female candidates to examine the effect of expanding the pipeline of women in local politics on subsequent female representation and success in parliamentary elections. For each additional state legislature election won by a woman, there is a 34 percent increase in the number of female candidates contesting in the subsequent parliamentary election. The effect can be traced to new candidates rather than career politicians. The average vote share received per female candidate also increases, indicating that exposure to local female politicians likely leads to updated beliefs about the viability of new female politicians at the national level.
