During graduate school, I taught Econometrics to 10 sections of over 300 undergraduate students over three years at Hunter College, CUNY (present in my first class ever was the notable <a href="http://www.twitter.com/yfeyman">@yfeyman</a>).

Training in Econometrics, in my view and experience, is possibly *the* defining aspect of an Economics major sought by companies, research organizations, and non-profits who hire Economics majors. I enjoy teaching a mix of theoretical and mathematical rigor as well as practical application using real-world data and programming in statistical software.

In this project, funded by Emory University's Center for Faculty Development and Excellence, I will combine and integrate multiple ongoing innovations in the teaching of Econometrics to develop and house a set of online materials that can be used to teach a “flipped” class of undergraduate Econometrics. 

This “flipped classroom” will comprise a set of materials that include:
-	Recorded video lectures,
-	Examples and practice learning materials built in R/RMarkdown that students can download and learn both principles and applications, primarily centered around real-world data and examples,
-	Lecture and teaching materials from the newly-added “lab” component of the Statistics & Econometrics sequence which teaches students the foundational programming tools for statistical and econometric analysis.

The project has a second component -- : connecting to professional application. This segment will invite non-academic professionals who use econometrics in practice to speak to students about their training, experience, and overall career paths.

Timeline: in development, beta completed by summer, 2020.
