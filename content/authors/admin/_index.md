I am a labor and development economist whose research focuses on the infrastructural determinants of firm creation and productivity, the role of institutions in producing gender gaps in education and career progression, and, most recently, the effect of information constraints on the targeting of large-scale social welfare programs. I joined the Department of Economics at Emory in the Fall of 2018. 

Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I've worked in economic consulting for a couple years, as well as consulted for the World Bank and other international or multilateral organizations on areas related to my research.
